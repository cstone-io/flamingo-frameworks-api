    Power flickers … momentary outages … brief service interruptions – these are some of the terms used to describe brief power outages lasting less than 60 seconds. Regardless of what you call them, they’re annoying because they can briefly shut down the electronic devices and appliances in your home or business. You want reliable electric service, and it’s our job to provide it.
    While we’ve made good progress in reducing power outages – providing customers with more than 99.98 percent service reliability – power flickers are an ongoing challenge for FPL and electric utilities nationwide. That’s why we’ve mounted a major effort – the first of its kind in the nation – to reduce those brief, yet frustrating flickers.
    We apologize if you’ve experienced a problem with your electric service due to power flickers. And we want you to know we’re working hard on our commitment to reduce them.
    See below for more information, as well as the accompanying video, fact sheet and FAQs.
    Why they occur
    Flickers may occur at any time – even on a sunny day – and can be caused by a number of factors, including:
    Lightning strikes (Florida is the lightning capital of the nation)
    Damaged electrical equipment
    Vegetation – tree branches, palm fronds or other debris – making contact with power lines
    Animals interfering with electrical equipment
    Salt spray affecting FPL equipment in coastal areas
    What happens
    Let's look at one example using the illustration below. One of the most common causes of power flickers is when a tree branch or palm frond is blown into overhead power lines. When the branch makes contact with our lines (A), the system detects the interference and shuts off electricity to that section of the line for a brief period – usually a few seconds (B). The tree branch or palm frond typically falls to the ground, allowing service to be restored quickly.
    This process allows the system to determine if there is a break in the line or other electrical difficulty. Briefly shutting off power and isolating the problem area helps prevent damage to the electric system, which could result in a longer outage and affect many more customers.
    For example, a flicker on your local power line could affect electric service for you and 200 of your neighbors. Without this brief interruption, the outage could last several hours, spread to other power lines and affect service for thousands of customers.
    Others may also be affected
    In addition to affecting customers served directly by the affected power line, other customers in the area who receive electric service from adjacent lines may also experience a flicker. Interference on the line, such as a fallen tree branch, often produces a brief drop in electricity – called a “voltage sag” – on adjacent power lines that affects customers served by those wires.
    Conversely, a lightning strike could cause a power “surge” – a brief, but noticeable increase in electricity in your home or business that may cause a flicker.
    How flickers affect you
    You may notice the lights flicker or experience a brief outage lasting several seconds. There also could be a series of flickers over a period of a few minutes. Although these outages are brief, we understand how frustrating they can be for you. Your appliances and electronic devices may shut off and need to be reset.
    In years past, the impact was minor, perhaps resulting in a flashing digital clock. But today, many of the items now common in homes and businesses – computers, microwave ovens, TVs, DVRs and more – are highly sensitive to changes in electricity flow. Resetting them can be both frustrating and time-consuming.
    Power flickers can even affect your service if you receive electricity from an underground power line. Underground wires ultimately connect with overhead lines and equipment located elsewhere on the power grid, away from your immediate area. Animals and reptiles also sometimes interfere with underground power cables.
    What we’re doing about it
    FPL is further researching the causes of power flickers to determine their full impact on customers. More importantly, we're identifying and taking steps to reduce their number.
    Advanced technologies – including smart meters – are helping us better understand what our customers experience when flickers occur. We’ve conducted an extensive analysis, and it’s apparent there is no single solution to reducing their frequency.
    That's why FPL is working aggressively on several fronts to achieve near- and longer-term results, including:
    Targeting power lines that experience the highest number of flickers for improvements, including equipment upgrades and new technology
    Investigating and testing a number of new cutting-edge technologies, including those designed to prevent problems caused by lightning and salt spray
    Clearing vegetation from 15,000 miles of power lines annually
    Adding new safeguards to discourage interference from animals and birds
    What you can do
    As we focus on reducing flickers, you can take steps to minimize their effect on your home or business. Devices such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and surge protectors can help maintain the flow of electricity and prevent possible damage to your appliances and equipment. Surge protectors act like electrical sponges, absorbing excess energy and preventing most of it from reaching your electronic devices.
    See our Guide to Power Outages for more information.
    Frequently asked questions
    At FPL, we understand how frustrating power outages, or flickers, can be – and we’re committed to reducing them and their impact on you. Here are the most common questions we receive from our customers. See our fact sheet, Reducing Power Flickers, for additional information.
    What causes power flickers?
    There are several factors that can trigger power flickers: lightning, damaged electrical equipment, and objects making contact with power lines, including tree branches, palm fronds and vegetation – even animals. In coastal areas, salt spray from the ocean can affect FPL equipment and cause flickers at your home or business.
    Why do they occur in good weather – even on a sunny day?
    While power flickers are more common during stormy or windy conditions, they can occur at any time and in any weather. The causes of flickers – animals and vegetation making contact with power lines, lightning and other factors – never take a rest.
    Why are homes and businesses served by an underground power line affected by flickers?
    Even if you receive electric service from underground power lines, you may be affected by brief outages because the underground wires ultimately connect with overhead lines and equipment – including power substations – that may be located away from your neighborhood. In addition, animals and reptiles sometimes interfere with our underground power cables, causing flickers or longer outages.
    Why do these brief outages seem to occur frequently in some neighborhoods?
    Power flickers can be caused by a number of factors (see above). If you are experiencing flickers or longer outages, please contact us at 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243) and we’ll work to improve your service.
    Can power flickers damage home appliances or other electronic devices?
    Any appliance or device that plugs into an electrical outlet can be affected by a disturbance in the flow of electricity into your home or business. More sophisticated equipment, such as computers, DVRs and satellite TVs, typically are the most sensitive to changes in electricity. There are several steps you can take to prevent problems when a flicker occurs. See our Guide to Power Outages brochure for extensive information on preventing, investigating and fixing power problems.
    What is FPL doing to prevent these brief power outages?
    Power flickers are a growing concern among electric utilities nationwide, and FPL has mounted a major effort to minimize them and their impact on you. We’re analyzing the cause of these brief power outages and testing new methods – including cutting-edge technologies – to alleviate them. It’s apparent there is no single solution to power flickers, and no technology or process currently exists to eliminate them. However, we’re taking action on a number of fronts as part of our commitment to reduce power flickers throughout our electric system.
    Is there anything customers can do to protect their electronic devices?
    Yes. Readily available “uninterruptible power supplies” (UPS) and surge protectors can help stabilize the flow of electricity and prevent damage to your appliances and equipment. See our Guide to Power Outages brochure for more information about how to troubleshoot issues and protect your equipment.
    Where should customers call to report power flickers?
    You can report a power outage – whether it lasts a few seconds or longer – by contacting us at 1-800-4OUTAGE(1-800-468-8243) or reporting the outage online.

    Keeping Your Electric Service Reliable
    Your guide to understanding power outages, troubleshooting issues,
    protecting your appliances and more.
    Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) understands that any power outage
    is an inconvenience. That’s why we continually invest in strengthening our
    infrastructure, use smart technology to prevent outages, and proactively clear
    vegetation from power lines.
    Each year we proactively clear tree branches from more than 15,000 miles
    of power lines across Florida and inspect more than 140,000 utility poles.
    At our Reliability Assurance Center, we simulate lightning strikes on our
    equipment to identify the best ways to prevent lightning from causing flickers
    in your home or business. These everyday initiatives are paying off by
    reducing outages and flickers.
    Despite our best efforts, no utility can ever be completely interruption-proof.
    Many forces can cause an outage, a flicker or changes in voltage. If you
    experience an outage or recurring power problems, call FPL and we’ll investigate
    to get your power problems resolved.
    Those Annoying Electric Disturbances
    Electric disturbances can appear in different forms. Some aren’t even noticeable but may leave signs such as a shrunken picture on your
    TV or computer screen.
    Brief Power Interruptions (Flickers)
    When your digital clock or DVD player blinks or your lights go off
    for a few seconds, you’ve experienced the most common power
    disturbance problem, a flicker. Flickers can be caused by:
    » Lightning strikes
    » Tree branches making contact with power lines
    » Vehicle accidents involving electrical equipment
    » Construction accidents involving power lines
    » Salt spray affecting FPL equipment
    » Damage to underground equipment
    Flickers are usually harmless and resolve themselves quickly. Here’s
    an example of how a flicker occurs: A palm tree frond comes into
    contact with a power line. FPL’s system automatically switches off
    electricity to give the frond time to clear the line. Once the frond is
    clear of power lines, FPL’s system resets itself.
    By switching off electricity for a few seconds, FPL prevents a full
    power outage.
    Surges and Spikes
    Unexpected burdens on the electric system, often from lightning,
    can cause a brief but intense increase in the amount of electricity
    in your home. Though they usually last less than a second, these
    surges and spikes can affect sensitive electronic equipment.
    Find out how to best protect your electronic devices on the "Protect
    Your Home or Business Against Power Disturbances" page.
    Partial Power Outages
    Sometimes, the power goes out in only part of your home or
    business. A partial power outage may be caused by a tripped
    circuit breaker, a blown fuse or a broken connector or wire at one
    of the service leads to the home or business.
    Sags and Swells
    Occasionally, the amount of voltage delivered to your home or
    business may briefly rise above or drop below normal. These
    variations are known as sags and swells and may cause shrunken
    displays on your TV or computer monitor.

    Investigating Your Power Disturbance
    Clues to Help Get to the Bottom of a Power Disturbance
    Troubleshooting Solution
    Are your neighbors or other businesses
    in your area affected?
    If not, check your circuit breaker and main breaker before calling an electrician or
    FPL. If you live in an apartment building or business complex and only you are out of
    power, call your building’s maintenance person for assistance. If your entire complex is
    experiencing power problems, call FPL at 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243) or report
    the problem online at www.FPL.com/outage.
    Does the problem come and go? Being
    aware of patterns can be helpful to
    you, an electrician or FPL in finding
    the cause and solution for your power
    disturbances.
    Look for patterns. It’s likely something has interfered to cause your power interruptions.
    Note the following when looking for patterns:
    » Does the problem occur at the same time of day?
    » Are the interruptions caused by the same device or appliance?
    » Is construction work going on in your area?
    » What was the weather like when the problem occurred?
    » Did you notice any loud noises outside near the time of the power interruption?
    » Have you recently added any new appliances to your home or business?
    Are two or more appliances or pieces
    of equipment running at the same time?
    Find out if sensitive equipment is sharing an electrical circuit with larger appliances or
    equipment such as motorized items.
    Has work recently been done on your
    home or business electrical system?
    Check any relevant installation manuals or troubleshooting guides, or call the
    electrician who did the work so that any incorrect installation, grounding or wiring can
    be corrected.
    Have you recently added new
    appliances to your home or business?
    Is the problem occurring in only one
    appliance or piece of equipment?
    Make sure the item is plugged in. Review the appliance instruction manual’s
    troubleshooting section. Contact the manufacturer for assistance, as needed.
    Are lights in your home or business
    going dim or bright and staying that
    way for an extended period of time?
    When lights in your home or business stay dim for an extended period, turn off major
    appliances and equipment and call FPL immediately.
    If the problem persists after you have completed the recommended steps, contact FPL at 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243)
    or report your power interruption online at www.FPL.com/outage.
    When Simple Solutions Don’t Work
    If these solutions don’t work, or if you suspect you have other electrical problems at your home or business, contact a qualified electrical
    contractor, licensed electrician or your building’s maintenance staff. Visit www.FPL.com/powerquality for more information and tips.
    Protect Your Home or Business
    Against Power Disturbances
    FPL’s Top Tips for Power Disturbance Protection
    Anything that plugs in at your home or business can be affected by a disturbance in the electricity entering the structure. More
    sophisticated equipment such as computers and security systems are the most sensitive to changes in electricity. Fortunately,
    you can take simple steps to prevent problems when a power disturbance occurs.
    Step 1: Back It Up – Back It Up – Back It Up
    » Purchase equipment with built-in backup protection, such
    as batteries that allow devices to remember clock and alarm
    settings after a power disturbance.
    » Purchase UPS devices. These switch your computer or
    other equipment to battery backup during a power loss,
    giving you time to save data.
    » Regularly back up computer data.
    » Protect your equipment with inside or outside surge
    protection—or for your best protection, use both.
    Step 2: Conduct an Electrical Checkup
    » Repair or replace damaged and loose wires, outlets
    and plugs.
    » Never plug computers and sensitive electronics into outlets
    also being used for motor-driven equipment, such as:
    – Photocopiers
    – Air conditioners/heating
    and cooling equipment
    – Refrigerators and freezers
    – Dishwashers
    – Ventilators
    – Furnaces
    – Vacuum cleaners
    – Air compressors
    – Irrigation pumps
    » Check your breaker box to make sure sensitive equipment,
    such as computers, doesn’t share circuits with energyhungry equipment such as air conditioners, refrigerators,
    washers, dryers and microwaves. Relocate equipment to
    other circuits or have an electrician make needed changes.
    » Plant trees away from power lines and keep branches
    trimmed. FPL recommends using a qualified contractor.
    Branches touching lines may cause brief power interruptions.
    Visit www.FPL.com/trees for more information, including a
    “Caring for Your Trees and Service” brochure.
    » Equip your air conditioner with a time-delay relay if it doesn’t
    already have one. This prevents the unit from restarting for
    about three to five minutes, minimizing the possibility of
    damage to your air conditioner’s compressor.
    » Follow manufacturers’ instructions for setting up all
    appliances and equipment.
    Step 3: Use Surge Protectors
    » Use of surge protectors prevents damage to your electrical
    equipment and appliances. The most obvious problems
    occur when lightning travels down electric, telephone or
    cable lines and affects computers and other electronics.
    However, the effects of surges can cause less noticeable
    damage over time as electronic components gradually
    break down. Because microchips are used in most major
    appliances, even this kind of equipment is vulnerable to
    surges and spikes.
    » Surge protectors act like electrical sponges, absorbing
    excess energy and preventing most of it from reaching
    your equipment. And, like sponges, surge protectors
    have a limited ability to absorb energy. That’s why it’s
    important to select a surge protector with the right features
    and ratings to match the equipment you want to protect.
    FPL recommends whole-house protection through a
    combination of inside and outside protection products.
    See a guide to selecting surge protection devices on the back
    page of this brochure.
    Fix That Power Problem
    Troubleshooting Power Disturbances
    The lights are flickering. Your alarm clock is flashing. You’re
    experiencing a power disturbance. Before you call FPL or an
    electrician, you can troubleshoot—and possibly fix your power
    problem, yourself!
    Sometimes solving a power problem is as easy as keeping
    track of when problems occur and what equipment in your
    home or business is affected. Start by knowing the electrical
    equipment in your home.
    Ground Fault Interrupt Circuits
    Ground fault interrupt (GFI) circuits are found where water can
    be a threat, such as near sinks, tubs, garages and outside
    your home or business. The GFI outlet is designed to shut off
    electricity to the entire circuit, as needed, to prevent electrical
    shock. To restore electricity to the circuit, the GFI outlet must be
    reset as follows:
    1. Unplug equipment from the outlets served by the
    GFI circuit.
    2. Locate the outlet that includes the GFI reset switch.
    3. Reset the switch. Make sure to press the “reset” button,
    not the “test” button. You should hear a click.
    4. Test the outlet by plugging the appliance back in and
    turning it on.
    5. If you still don’t have power, try resetting the breaker
    at the breaker panel, usually located in your garage or
    utility space.
    6. If these steps don’t restore power, call 1-800-4OUTAGE
    (1-800-468-8243).
    Examining the Mystery of Breakers
    If the power goes out in only a portion of your home or
    business, or if only some appliances and equipment stop
    working, you may have a tripped breaker. Breakers are safety
    devices that protect your home or business when short circuits
    or electrical overloads occur.
    Before problems occur, it’s important to know where the breaker
    panel is located, and to make sure you can get to it quickly.
    Most can be found in the garage, a hallway, or outside near
    the electric meter.
    A properly installed breaker is safe to operate, but remember
    that electricity can be dangerous, so it pays to call an
    electrician if you have problems with any of these steps.
    Resetting a Breaker
    1. Open your breaker box and look at your breaker switches.
    You will know a breaker is “tripped” when the lever is
    halfway between the “On” and “Off” positions.
    2. Reset the breaker by switching it all the way off, then back on.
    Note: If the breaker for your air conditioner is tripped, wait
    five minutes before resetting it. Doing this will prevent motor
    damage to your air conditioning unit. If the breaker trips
    again, do not reset it. You may have a serious electrical
    problem. Contact an electrician.
    Resetting a Main Breaker
    If power is completely out at your home or business, but
    neighbors or nearby businesses are not affected, you may
    have a tripped main breaker.
    1. Turn off all circuit breakers inside your breaker box.
    2. Find the main breaker switch, often located near the
    electric meter outside your home or in your breaker box.
    3.Reset the switch by turning it off and on two times.
    4. Turn all breakers back to “On” inside the breaker box.
    Surge Protection
    Inside Surge Protection
    Inside surge protection devices are installed directly between the
    equipment you want to protect and the wall outlet, acting as the
    last line of defense against surges generated inside or outside your
    home or business.
    Before buying surge protectors, determine how many—and what
    type of surge protection—you need. You can save money and
    space by purchasing multiple-outlet surge protectors that prevent
    damage to several pieces of equipment.
    When protecting sensitive electronics such as computers and TVs,
    be sure to use a surge protector with connections for all attached
    cables. For example, all devices connected to a computer,
    including the router or modem, should plug into the surge
    protector. The phone line should be routed to the modem from the
    surge protector.
    Outside Surge Protection
    Outside surge protectors, often called surge arresters, can be
    installed on the electric meter or breaker box to protect telephone
    and cable lines from being damaged by power surges.
    Protection at the meter does not protect other points of entry such
    as phone, cable, data lines, DSL or satellite. For full protection, also
    consider the options described in the table below.
    Protection Needed Equipment
    Power Line Protection Any sensitive electronic device, appliance with microchips (most modern appliances) or
    microprocessor, telephone answering machine, fax machine, modem, TV, DVD player, DVR
    Cable Line Protection TV, DVD player, DVR, cable modem
    Whole House Surge Arrester Main electric breaker switch
    Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) Computer, telephone, data line, peripheral device, other equipment
    Digital Satellite Jack Satellite TV
    Telephone Line Protection Telephone, answering machine, fax machine, modem, credit-approval system,
    security system
    Surge Protection Features: Know What You’re Buying
    When you purchase a surge protector, check for the following features:
    United Laboratories (UL)-listed transient
    voltage surge suppressor UL-listed surge protectors meet important industry standards.
    Clamping Voltage / Let-Through Voltage
    This is the amount of voltage the unit passes through to your equipment before
    diverting voltage to the ground. The lower the number, the better. The lowest
    clamping voltage recognized by UL is 330 volts, sometimes listed as .33 kilovolts.
    Alarm or Light These let you know when your surge protector no longer works.
    Power Shutdown Protection This shuts power off when the surge protector has stopped working so that no
    electricity can flow.
    EMI/RFI Protection This guards against data loss, audio static, video interference and possible
    computer memory loss from electromagnetic and radio frequency interference.
    Response Time Rating The faster the surge protector can react to high voltage, the better.

    If you are experiencing power issues, there are a few simple checks you can perform before calling FPL or your electrician. Sometimes solving the problem is simply a matter of keeping track of when problems occur and which equipment is affected.
    Are your neighbors affected?
    If not, check your circuit breaker, fuse box or main breaker before calling an electrician or FPL. Reset a breaker or replace a fuse.
    If you live in an apartment building and only your power is out, call your building's maintenance person for assistance.
    If your entire apartment complex's lights are flickering or out:
    Call FPL at 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243)
    Report the outage online
    Does the problem come and go?
    Look for patterns. More than likely something might have interfered to cause a quick on and off of electricity. Things that you may want to consider when looking for patterns:
    Does the problem happen at the same time of day?
    Is construction work going on in your neighborhood?
    How was the weather?
    Was there a loud noise outside the home?
    Have you added any new appliances to your household?
    Being aware of patterns can be a valuable tool for you, an electrician or FPL in finding the cause and solution to your power disturbances.
    Is other household equipment running at the same time?
    Find out if sensitive equipment is sharing the same electrical circuit as large appliances or motors, or if too much equipment is on one circuit. If so, relocate the sensitive equipment to a different outlet or circuit.
    Has recent work been performed on your home's electrical system? Have you recently added new appliances or equipment to your home?
    Check your installation manual, troubleshooting guide, or call the electrician who did the work to find out if incorrect installation, grounding or wiring is causing problems with other equipment in your home.
    Is the problem happening with only one specific appliance or electronic device?
    If so, review the instruction manual provided with the item to see if it provides troubleshooting tips or contact the manufacturer for assistance and advice with identifying the cause of the problem. Also, you may want to check to see if the equipment is plugged into a ground fault interrupt (GFI) outlet. Troubleshoot a GFI outlet.
    Are lights in your home going dim or bright and staying dim for an extended period of time?
    When lights in your home stay dim for an extended period, turn off major appliances and call FPL.
    Is there static on your cordless telephone, radio or television when another appliance is running?
    The problem may be electrical interference. Troubleshoot electrical interference.
    When simple solutions don't work
    Power outages and electrical disturbances can be caused by problems within your home, such as:
    Circuit overloads
    Electrical short circuits
    Home wiring damage
    If the solutions here don't work, or you suspect you have electrical problems at your home, contact a qualified electrical contractor or electrician. Friends and relatives are your best source for references.

  body: >
    Resetting your breakers can sometimes restore power to your home. If your power goes out, check to see if your neighbors' lights are still on. If they are, you can try to resolve your issue by resetting your breakers. This may get your power back on right away
    Here's an easy, three-step guide to resetting your breakers:
    Find the breaker panel in your home - it may be in your garage - and turn off every breaker, one by one.
    Next, reset your main breaker. If your main breaker is not in your breaker panel, it will be outside near your electric meter. Do not touch the meter. Open the panel beside the meter. Reset the main breaker by turning the switch off and on two times. Leave the switch in the on position.
    Return to the breaker panel inside your home and turn each breaker back to the on position, one by one. In many cases, power is now restored.
    Keep these safety tips in mind when resetting your breakers:
    Don't use any tools. Your breakers are easily accessible by hand.
    Don't touch the electric meter.
    Don't stand in water when turning breakers on or off.
    If your power still does not come on after completing this process, please call us at 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243).

    The best solution to electrical interference is eliminating the source. Follow the steps below to discover the source of electrical interference in your home:
    Turn on the appliance that is experiencing the interference - for example, the phone or radio that has static.
    Go the breaker box and flip each circuit breaker in your home off and then on again while someone stays with the affected appliance.
    The interference will disappear when the breaker causing it is flipped off.
    Turn the offending breaker back on to confirm it is the source.
    Identify the electrical devices in your home connected to the breaker and turn them on.
    Turn the electrical devices off, one by one, until the interference disappears.
    Once you find the device that is causing the interference, repair or replace it.
    If you cannot locate the equipment that is causing the interference, report it:
    a.  Report trouble online
    b.  Call 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243)
    Interference problems due to loose connections
    Electrical interference can be caused by loose connections or bad wiring behind a wall, panel or outlet. Have a qualified electrician conduct an inspection of your wiring system to identify and eliminate the interference conditions.
    Interference problems originating outside
    If none of the above measures are successful, the chances are that the interference is coming from outside. You can also request an electric interference investigation. Note: If you have not registered, you will be asked to complete a one-time registration. You will need your FPL account number and the last four digits of the Social Security or Tax ID number that is associated with your account.

  title: Power Disturbances and Solutions Frequently Asked Questions
  link: https://www.fpl.com/reliability/power-disturbances/faq.html
  body: >
    What should I do if my power goes out?
    Find out if your neighbors are affected.
    If your neighbors are also without power, contact FPL at 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243) or report your outage online.
    If your neighbors are not without power, you may need to reset your breakers.
    What is a breaker?
    A breaker is a protective switch located on an electrical circuit that can interrupt the flow of abnormally large currents. A circuit breaker is the most common means of providing overload and fault protection for customers and utilities.
    What should I do if my power is flickering or fluctuating?
    If you live in a single-family home, contact FPL at 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243) or report your outage online.
    If you live in an apartment/multi-unit dwelling:
    Verify if your neighbors are affected.
    If your neighbors are affected, contact FPL: 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243) Report your outage online
    If your neighbors are not affected, try resetting your breakers.
    If the flicker/fluctuating still continues, you may need to contact a licensed electrician.
    What is a flicker and why do they occur?
    Power interruptions lasting less than one minute are known as flickers, and they may occur at any time – even on a sunny day. They can be caused by a number of factors, including:
    Lightning strikes
    Damaged electrical equipment
    Vegetation – tree branches, palm fronds or other debris
    Animals interfering with electrical equipment
    Salt spray affecting FPL equipment in coastal areas
    Similar to a circuit breaker in your home, a flicker occurs when our system automatically shuts off electricity to isolate the problem area. When the line is cleared, our system resets itself and electric service is quickly restored. Briefly shutting off power and isolating the problem helps prevent damage to the electric system, which could result in a longer outage and affect many more customers.
    FPL has launched a major initiative – the first of its kind in the nation – to reduce power “flickers” (outages lasting less than 60 seconds) and their impact on our customers. Visit Power Flickers for more information.
    What is a voltage fluctuation?
    A voltage fluctuation is a dip or spike in the flow of electricity to your home. The state of Florida requires that utilities normally operate within a range of plus- or minus six volts (114 - 126) from standard voltage (120). Fluctuations of more than six volts may cause your lights to dim or brighten.
    What is the difference between flickering lights and fluctuating lights?
    Lights flicker when the power in your home abruptly turns off but comes back on within seconds. Fluctuations cause your lights to dim or get brighter than usual.
    Why is my power out while my neighbor has power?
    In many instances, a single street is served by two different main power lines and even different substations. Your neighbor’s home may be served by a power line or substation that has not been affected while the power line or substation serving your home is damaged.
    Additional reasons your power can be out while other houses on your street have power include:
    Fuses or circuit breakers in your home may be tripped
    Tree limbs may have fallen on the line serving your home
    Fuses on the transformer that serves your home may have blown or become damaged
    The primary line feeding the transformer serving your home may be damaged
    Why do I only have electricity in one part of my house?
    Causes of a partial power outage include:
    A tripped circuit breaker
    A blown fuse
    A broken connector or wire at one of the service leads to your house
    Sometimes damaged service leads leave only 120-volt outlets working. In this case, larger appliances that require 240-volt service—such as water heaters, air conditioning and ovens—may be inoperable until repairs are made. It is safe to use the outlets you have available while you check with an electrician or await restoration by FPL. If the problem involves a service lead to your home, FPL crews will repair them when they arrive.
    If my power is restored, can I expect it to stay on?
    Once service is restored, we make every effort to keep it on. However, as we repair other parts of our system, additional interruptions can occur. If a power outage occurs, contact FPL at 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243) or report your outage online.
    Can I pay an electrician to change my FPL service wires or cables?
    No. Electricians are not allowed to work on FPL lines from the pole or transformer to your house.
    Why would FPL crews pass my house without repairing anything?
    If you see an FPL crew passing but not stopping, it may be because work must be performed at a nearby location before electric service can be restored to your home.
    How does FPL provide for people with special medical problems, such as those on life-sustaining medical equipment?
    Any customer who has continuously operating, electric-powered medical equipment necessary to sustain life or prevent serious medical complications may participate in FPL's Medical Essential Service Program (MESP). Please know that the program does not guarantee uninterrupted service, and it does not exempt customers from payment of their electric bills. MESP customers are responsible for having backup power supply and a plan in the event of power outages.
    How can I protect my electronic equipment from being damaged?
    Read our Guide to Power Outage.
    If my UPS (battery backup) beeps, does that mean that I have a power problem?
    Not necessarily. The voltage that flows through electrical lines fluctuates slightly on a normal basis.
    Some UPS products have a fluctuation threshold of five volts, meaning that the UPS will go into battery mode in response to a minor voltage fluctuation of six volts.
    If your UPS activates unnecessarily, try these steps:
    Reference your UPS owner's manual or contact the manufacturer about how to change the threshold to eight volts.
    Check the battery for expiration. UPS batteries have an average lifespan of two years.
    If your UPS beeps and you’re experiencing dimming or brightening of lights, please call FPL at 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243) or report your problem online.
    What is a power quality disturbance?
    A power quality disturbance is any change in the electricity reaching your home that interferes with normal operation of electrical equipment. Unprotected computers and other sensitive electronic equipment are susceptible to damage from power quality disturbances.
    Shouldn't I expect FPL to provide me with interruption-proof power?
    FPL understands that any power disturbance is an inconvenience. That’s why we continually invest in strengthening our infrastructure, use smart technology to prevent outages, and proactively clear vegetation from power lines. Despite our best efforts, no utility can ever be completely interruption-proof. Many forces can cause an outage, a flicker or changes in voltage. If you experience an outage or recurring power problems, call FPL at 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243) or report your outage online.

    If you don't see your outage on the map and want to report it online, please visit our Web Outage Reporting System.
    Why can't the map find my address?
    FPL's map is built on the Google Maps platform. While Google Maps strives to update its address database on a consistent basis, some new housing developments may take months to show up on maps. To suggest a correction or addition to Google's database, please contact the Google Earth map team.
    How do I check the status of an existing outage?
    To check the status of an existing outage, please visit our Web Outage Reporting System.
    How do I report a new outage?
    To report an outage, please visit our Web Outage Reporting System or call 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243).
    How do I report a streetlight outage or problem?
    If you notice a streetlight problem, please let us know by visiting FPL.com/streetlight or by calling 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243). When you contact FPL, please have the following information ready:
    The location of the streetlight, including the nearest street address and any nearby landmarks. Alternately, you may provide the 11-digit number mounted on the streetlight pole.
    A description of the problem.
    Your contact information, including name, address, email address or phone number.
    Not all streetlights are maintained by FPL. Your request may require your local municipality or homeowners association to make final repairs.
    Why doesn't the map zoom all the way in to a specific street address?
    For safety and security reasons, FPL's Power Tracker does not display outage information for specific street addresses.
    How can I tell when my power will be restored?
    Clicking on any outage icon will reveal more information about the outage, including the estimated time of restoration.
    If you reported an outage more than 15 minutes ago and can't find it on the map, you may want to check your restoration status on our Web Outage Reporting System.
    What does the information box tell me?
    The information box that appears when you click on an outage icon provides greater detail about that particular outage, including:
    Outage reported - The time that the outage began or was reported.
    Estimated time of restoration - The time that FPL estimates power will be restored to the customers affected. The estimated time of restoration is based on the cause of the outage, availability of restoration resources and how long we expect the restoration work to take. Please keep in mind that this time is an estimate and is subject to change as we receive more information during the restoration effort. Sometimes restoration happens faster or slower than expected.
    Customers affected – The number of FPL customers who are affected by this particular outage.
    Status – The current status of the restoration.
    Cause – What caused the outage to occur.
    Last updated - The time the information in the bubble was last refreshed.
    I reported an outage but I don't see it on the map. Why not?
    To see a specific outage on the map, type in the exact street address. If you still do not see your outage, please wait 15 minutes and refresh your browser, as this is how frequently the map information is updated, on average.
    I'm out of power but I don't see an icon on my exact location. Why not?
    Because outages generally affect several customers rather than a single location, the outage icon may not appear directly over your exact location. For outages affecting two to 100 customers, the icon will generally appear close to the streets affected. For larger outages, the icon may be farther away and still represent your home or business. You can think of the icon as representing the "center" of the outage; the outage may cover several streets or, in the case of major events, even miles.
    What do the outage icons mean?
    Each of the triangle icons indicates the location of a specific outage. Since outages can affect varying numbers of FPL customers, the icons are color-coded according to the size of the outage. The map legend indicates how many affected customers a particular icon color represents.
    What does it mean when three little triangle icons are clustered together on the map, signifying "More than one outage in the area" per the map legend?
    Visible at high zoom levels, the "cluster" icon represents multiple outages in a particular region — it essentially summarizes the outages within a region. You may see it when you are viewing the Power Tracker map while zoomed out. As you zoom in on the map, the cluster icon will be replaced by individual triangle icons showing specific outage information, including the number of customers affected by each outage and estimated times of restoration. If you see a cluster icon and you want to know more, keep clicking "Zoom in" until the individual outage triangle icons are revealed.
    What is the FPL Systemwide Reliability Performance indicator?
    The Reliability Performance indicator is a tool that displays the percent of FPL customer accounts that currently have power. This gauge provides a near-real-time reflection of FPL's overall service reliability performance.
    FPL currently serves about 5.8 million customer accounts, so a Reliability Performance number of 99.98% would indicate that of those 5.8 million, approximately 5,798,840 customer accounts have power at the moment and approximately 1160 are without power. Every .01% represents about 580 customer accounts.
    FPL is committed to delivering safe, reliable electric service. Our customers receive more than 99.98 percent service reliability, and we're working every day to make our service even better.
    How often does FPL update Power Tracker?
    We update the map approximately every 15-30 minutes. To see the most current restoration information, you may need to refresh your browser.
    What is FPL doing to prevent outages?
    At FPL, we're investing to make our infrastructure stronger every day, in good weather and bad. However, no utility can ever be 100 percent interruption-proof. Outages occur for a variety of reasons, including strong winds, lightning, interference from vegetation or animals, car accidents and equipment problems.
    FPL follows a comprehensive plan to make your electric service more reliable. This plan includes:
    Inspecting utility poles
    Clearing vegetation from power lines
    Strengthening main power lines
    Using smart technology
    Inspecting power lines with advanced infrared technology
    To see the reliability investments we've made in your neighborhood, visit our System Improvements Map at FPL.com/maps
    How does FPL's reliability compare to other utilities?
    Florida Power & Light customers have the nation’s most reliable electric service, as recognized by PA Consulting, which honored FPL with the 2022 National Reliability Award. This marks the seventh time in eight years FPL has won the award., The award recognizes electric utilities that provide customers with the highest levels of reliability and is widely regarded as one of the industry's most prestigious honors.
    In addition to the strategic investments we’ve made to build the grid of the future, the award recognizes the efforts of our dedicated employees, who passionately serve the community in good weather and bad. Since the historic 2004-2005 hurricane seasons, FPL has installed more than 6 million smart meters and more than 200,000 intelligent devices. These initiatives have increased reliability each year – and have led to more than 10 million outages avoided since 2011.
    How does FPL restore power?
    When outages occur, we know our customers want and need information about when their power will be restored. Our crews work to restore power as soon as it is safe to begin. Their first order of business is diagnosing the cause of the outage so that we can provide our best estimate of when your service will be restored.
    As soon as FPL detects an outage or a customer reports an outage, we deploy a restoration specialist to conduct a situation assessment. In addition to helping us provide an estimated time of restoration, the work of this specialist helps us assign the right resources, workers and materials to get the power back on.
    During large outages, FPL follows an overall plan that calls for restoring power to the greatest number of customers safely and as quickly as possible. After a hurricane, our restoration process is as follows:
    FPL restores power plants and affected transmission lines and substations, which are essential to providing any electric service.
    Simultaneously, we restore power to electrical lines and equipment that serve critical facilities such as hospitals, police/fire stations, water treatment plants and 911 communication centers.
    At the same time, FPL works to return service to the largest number of customers in the shortest amount of time, including service to the main thoroughfares that host supermarkets, pharmacies, gas stations and other needed community services.
    From here, FPL repairs the infrastructure serving smaller groups and neighborhoods, converging on the hardest hit areas until every customer is restored.
    After a hurricane, what information will be available on this map?
    When outages occur, we know our customers want and need information about when their power will be restored so they can plan. However, information is scarce during and immediately after a major storm.
    If a major storm affects FPL's service territory, we will deploy field teams to conduct damage assessments. This helps us assign the right resources, crews and materials to each effort and provide customers an estimate of when repairs will be finished and power restored in their areas. We will provide key information on the map and on FPL.com:
    As soon as practical after the storm passes, FPL will provide a preliminary estimate of how long it will take to restore service based on its models and historical information from similar storms.
    Within 24 hours after the storm, based on initial damage assessments, FPL will update its systemwide estimate.
    Within 48 hours, FPL will provide restoration information on a county basis.
    Within 72 to 96 hours, FPL will provide information on a sub-county level.
    Throughout the restoration, FPL will communicate frequently through the news media, the FPL website (FPL.com), FPL's Storm Center (FPL.com/storm), Twitter (@insideFPL), Facebook (Facebook.com/FPLconnect), and YouTube (Youtube.com/FPL) to provide updated restoration expectations and other progress reports.
    How can I access Power Tracker if my power is out?
    During an outage at your home or place of business, you can access the Power Tracker map via a battery-powered laptop, a smart phone or Internet device (such as an iPhone, Android or iPad), through a friend or from a computer at different location.
    Is there a mobile version for my smart phone?
    Power Tracker is available on most Internet devices, including smart phones, at FPL.com/powertracker.
    So neighborhood outage information will not be available following a major storm event? Isn't that when Power Tracker is most needed?
    In the event that a major tropical storm or hurricane strikes FPL's service territory, the map will enter storm mode and will not display real-time information for the affected counties during initial phases of restoration. Depending on the path and intensity of the storm, it could take several days for crews to get into each neighborhood and provide detailed restoration expectations. While FPL is exercising its storm response plan, Power Tracker's information will be consistent with the company's storm news media reports, which are updated four times per day. FPL also will communicate restoration information to you via our Storm Center (FPL.com/storm), Twitter (@insideFPL), Facebook (Facebook.com/FPLconnect), and YouTube (Youtube.com/FPL).
    How long after the storm will the Power Tracker map be back to functioning regular capacity? Will I ever be able to use the map in a severe weather event?
    Our goal will be to restore Power Tracker to full functionality as soon as possible, but there are many variables with each storm that could affect the map's transition from storm mode back to blue sky mode. We know that when outages occur, our customers want and need information about when their power will be restored so they can plan. However, information is scarce during and immediately after a major storm. If a major storm impacts FPL's service territory, we will deploy field teams to conduct damage assessments. This helps us assign the right resources, crews and materials to each effort and provide customers an estimate of when repairs will be finished and power restored in their areas. We will provide key information on the map and on FPL.com:
    As soon as practical after the storm passes, FPL will provide a preliminary estimate of how long it will take to restore service based on its models and historical information from similar storms.
    Within 24 hours after the storm, based on initial damage assessments, FPL will update its systemwide estimate.
    Within 48 hours, FPL will provide restoration information on a county basis.
    Within 72 to 96 hours, FPL will provide information on a sub-county level.
    Throughout the restoration, FPL will communicate frequently through the news media, the FPL website (FPL.com), FPL's Storm Center (FPL.com/storm), Twitter (@insideFPL), Facebook (Facebook.com/FPLconnect), and YouTube (Youtube.com/FPL) to provide updated restoration expectations and other progress reports.
    If the information on the map is incorrect, should customers call you to let you know?
    The Power Tracker map updates every 15 minutes on average, so you should enter an exact address and refresh again in 15 minutes if you do not see information on an outage. Because outages generally affect several customers rather than a single location, the outage icon may not appear directly over your exact location. You can use the arrows found on the compass at the top left corner of the map to search for the outage icon representing the outage in your area.
    Isn't there a privacy issue with this information being so publicly available without an account number/password?
    Power Tracker protects the privacy and security of FPL customers by not allowing users to zoom to a street-level address.

article_13:
  title: Line Clearing Program
  link: https://www.fpl.com/reliability/trees/line-clearing.html
  body: >
    When trees grow into or near power lines, they can cause power interruptions to you and your neighborhood. FPL’s strategy to maintain power lines free of tree growth is based on a consistent, planned trimming cycle. Trimming the entire length of a power line on a regular basis – instead of trimming individual locations – ensures the integrity of the power line. If a tree condition needs attention outside of regular maintenance, FPL will let you know by leaving an inspection notice card with a scheduled work date.
    FPL Line Clearing Program
    How FPL trims trees
    Once a line is selected for maintenance as part of the scheduled program:
    The entire length of the power line is checked for vegetation issues.
    Trees and any other vegetation that are in the direct path of the power line are identified for maintenance. FPL will not trim every tree in close proximity to the line. It is the customer’s responsibility to have the other trees trimmed.
    FPL’s qualified tree-trimming contractors perform the work using “directional pruning.”This method is a professional technique of pruning trees away from power lines, removing entire branches and limbs up to the main trunk of the tree, where trees normally shed them. Future tree growth is then directed away from the power lines and re-growth is reduced. Directional pruning does not interfere with the tree’s natural defense system that protects it from decay and is supported by years of experience and research.
    Trees that interfere with FPL facilities and cannot be pruned without dramatically affecting the shape or health of the tree are completely removed. Trees with high growth rates, exotic weed trees and trees in poor health are prime targets for removal. The customer is notified in advance of the tree’s removal and, as a courtesy, consent is obtained before removing the tree.
    After a tree is trimmed or removed, the remaining debris is collected before the end of the next day except during any restoration efforts immediately following a storm.
    Preventative maintenance
    While only specially trained line-clearing professionals should work around power lines, you can always do your part in making sure that trees and other vegetation do not become an issue by:
    Routinely trimming the trees on your property that are away from power lines. Do not wait for a hurricane or any other major event as the debris from the trimming may become dangerous with storm-force winds. Never attempt to trim any vegetation growing near or on any overhead power lines.
    When selecting which trees to plant in your yard, always be sure to plant the “right tree” in the “right place.” FPL offers information on recommended trees to plant in your area along with help in considering where to plant them with our “Right Tree, Right Place” program.
    Mulch
    When our line-clearing contractors are trimming trees in your area, you may be eligible for free mulch.
    Once FPL’s line-clearing professionals have completed work in your area, they will use a wood chipper to grind the tree limbs and branches into mulch.  This type of mulch is different from store-bought mulch, which is treated and made from one kind of tree. The quality and consistency of this mulch varies considerably, depending on the types of trees and leaves removed during the tree work.
    FPL does not recommend this mulch for aesthetic use in formal landscape beds, but rather for use around trees and other plants to:
    Maintain moisture
    Maintain soil temperature
    Reduce weeds and grasses
    Provide nutrients to the soil, and
    Reduce wind erosion from uncovered soils.
    Orders for mulch are filled based on a minimum of one truckload. This is equal to 14 cubic yards of mulch, which is approximately 130 bags from a retail store or 25 wheelbarrow loads.
    To order free mulch, call the phone number on the letter or door card you received to request an application.

    Stay away from power lines
    At FPL, safety is a cornerstone of our commitment to customers and employees. We urge you to stay safe and stay far away from power lines at all times. Click on the videos below to learn more.

    downed power lines
    keep distance
    stay safe
    Don't put your life on the line
    If you decide to work outside, look up and note the location of power lines before you begin. Careful avoidance of power lines is extremely important during yard work, especially when using tools, ladders, poles or pruning saws. Be sure that ladders, mechanical lifts or scaffolds are far enough away so that you – and any tools you are using – don’t come within 10 feet of neighborhood power lines or 30 feet of all other power lines.
    FPL Power Line Safety
    Keep your distance
    You can be seriously hurt or killed if the object you are holding contacts a power line. Even nonmetallic ladders and equipment can conduct electricity. You must keep at least 10 feet away from any power line, from the end or tip of your own extended reach and including the end or tip of any object you are holding or carrying. (Please note that you must allow even greater distance for safety near higher voltage lines such as transmission lines.)
    Never trim near power lines
    Never attempt to trim vegetation or vines growing near power lines or on poles. Only specially trained line-clearing professionals should work around power lines. Check your local listings to locate a contractor qualified to trim vegetation around power lines.
    Know your utility lines
    Typically, you don’t have to worry about coming into contact with power lines since they are either buried safely underground or mounted on poles a safe distance from expected activity.  However, you must always assume that all overhead wires and cables and any underground wires or cables that you may encounter are energized and potentially dangerous.
    Electric lines are usually located at the top of the utility pole, farthest from the ground. Cable television and telephone lines run closer to the ground, below power lines. Please contact your local cable and phone utilities for information about trimming requirements or problems with their lines.
    Call before you dig
    Planning a home improvement project? Planting a tree? Installing a fence or deck? Wait! Florida law requires that you call 811 to locate and mark buried power lines and other utilities before you dig, whether you’re planning to do the work yourself or hire a professional. Call 811 or visit www.call811.com at least two business days before you begin work to avoid unintentionally hitting underground utility lines. This free service helps keep everyone safe.
    Call if you see a downed power line
    If you see a downed power line or other damaged electrical equipment, be sure to stay far away and immediately call 911 or FPL at 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243).
    Storm safety
    When a power outage occurs, your safety is our main concern. Here are some basic tips to keep you and your family safe while the power is out:
    Assume all cables and wires are energized and stay away.
    Keep away from flooded and debris-laden areas because they may be hiding downed lines.
    Avoid driving in damaged areas. You might interfere with rescue or restoration efforts, as well as jeopardize your own safety.
    Report downed power lines by calling FPL at 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243).

  title: Right Tree, Right Place
  link: https://www.fpl.com/reliability/trees/tree-location.html
  body: >
    Trees and power lines don't mix
    Trees and vegetation making contact with overhead power lines are a leading cause of outages and flickers. Planting the right tree in the right place so it doesn’t grow near power lines can help reduce outages for you and your neighbors.
    Download our "How keeping trees away from power lines improves your electric service" brochure for more smart landscaping tips and information on trimming trees and plants near power lines.
    Here are five simple steps to smart landscaping:
    1. Find the Right Tree – Trees come in all shapes and sizes, and often change dramatically over their lifetimes. Some grow tall, some grow wide and some have extensive root systems. Before selecting your tree, make sure you know how tall, wide and deep it will be at maturity. For lists of recommended trees for your region of Florida, please visit the University of Florida’s “Trees and Power Lines” website.
    2. Choose the Right Spot – If you’re planting trees on your property, look up and note the location of power lines. Before you plant, keep in mind the setback dimensions in our diagram. Think about how your tree will impact existing utility lines as it grows taller, wider and deeper. Keeping trees away from power lines means that, in the event they blow over or tree limbs become loose, they’re much less likely to hit a power line and knock out power. This also keeps debris farther away from the lines to speed power restoration efforts.
    tree setback image
    3. Call Before You Dig – If you'll be performing work in your yard that involves digging, Florida law requires you call 811 before you begin so FPL and other utilities can show you where cables and pipes are. Call at least two business days before you begin to avoid unintentionally hitting underground utility lines. This free service helps keep everyone safe. You can also submit your request online at www.Sunshine811.com.
    4. Keep transformers clear – Keep the transformer cabinet (green box often found in front of homes) clear at all times to allow for maintenance and repairs. Maintain a “clear zone” of 8 feet in the front and 3 feet in the back and on both sides.
    5. Stay safe around power lines – If you have trees and plants growing near power lines on your property, hire a qualified professional to perform trimming work. Do not take it upon yourself to perform any work near power lines. Whether you're planting a tree, preparing your property for storm season or picking fruit, remember to stay safe and stay far away from power lines at all times.
    Always keep yourself and any object you are holding at least 10 feet from main and neighborhood power lines and 30 feet from higher voltage transmission lines. You can be seriously hurt or worse, should you or anything you are touching come into contact with a power line.
    FPL Tree Facts
    FPL operates more than 75,000 miles of overhead power lines.
    Trees and plants making contact with power lines are among the leading causes of outages.
    Each year FPL maintains vegetation along 15,000 miles of power lines throughout its service area.
    FPL’s preventive maintenance plan calls for clearing main power lines every three years and neighborhood lines every six years, on average.
    One of the most important things homeowners and businesses can do is follow FPL’s Right Tree/Right Place guidelines. By selecting the right tree and planting in the right place, you can help reduce power outages in your neighborhood.
    To protect the health of trees, FPL follows the International Society of Arboriculture and American National Standard Institute pruning guidelines.

article_16:
  title: Trees and Power Lines Frequently Asked Questions
  link: https://www.fpl.com/reliability/trees/faq.html
  body: >
    Why does FPL prune trees?
    To assure reliable service for our customers, FPL follows a preventive maintenance program to regularly clear tree branches and limbs from electrical equipment and lines to help prevent outages. FPL will only prune or trim branches and limbs that can potentially cause safety hazards and power outages by brushing against or falling upon power lines during windy weather.
    How much will be cut from my trees?
    FPL’s line-clearing program will only target trees and other vegetation that can interfere with or damage power lines and equipment. The amount of pruning varies by tree and location, and our specially trained line-clearing professionals will consider each tree’s species, growth rate, health and the relative location to electrical lines and equipment before pruning. We all appreciate a lush, green community, and we can have it in such a way that minimizes the likelihood that tree branches and limbs will knock down power lines.
    Why does my tree have a V-shape following utility pruning and will this affect its stability?
    FPL uses a directional pruning method to direct future tree growth away from power lines and help make our electrical system more reliable in the future. This means that only the tree’s interior branches that are growing toward the electrical lines and equipment are removed. Since the roots act as an anchoring system, this will not affect the stability of the tree.
    Which pruning guidelines does FPL follow?
    FPL and its contractors follow directional pruning guidelines set by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to protect the health of trees while helping them to grow away from power lines. ANSI A-300 is accepted as the industry standard for tree and plant pruning and is endorsed by the National Arbor Day Foundation and the International Society of Arboriculture.
    What contractors does FPL use to trim trees?
    FPL uses only utility-qualified professional tree-trimming contractors to manage the trees and plants around its power lines and equipment. The contractors are leaders in the field of utility arboriculture and use proven industry-standard pruning techniques.
    What safety standards do FPL’s tree-trimming contractors follow?
    Our contractor workforce is required to follow all safety rules and regulations as outlined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). OSHA 1910.269 includes training requirements for line-clearance workers, minimum approach distances, hazard assessment and first aid/CPR training requirements.
    How often is line clearing completed?
    We’ve examined our processes and developed a line-clearing schedule that enhances our system’s reliability while focusing our resources efficiently and wisely. On average, the main power lines (feeders) are cleared every three years and the neighborhood power lines (laterals) are cleared every six years. FPL completes the majority of scheduled line clearing before the height of storm season to help minimize the amount of debris that can fly into poles and wires during the windy weather.
    Is there a charge for this service?
    FPL does not charge for this service since it is our responsibility to protect our lines and equipment. If FPL line-clearing professionals or other associated personnel are requesting compensation, please report the situation to FPL by calling 1-800-226-3545.
    Is pruning healthy for the tree?
    Any time a tree is wounded, it is placed under stress. FPL uses directional pruning to reduce the stress placed upon a tree. Directional pruning does not interfere with the tree’s ability to seal wounds, allowing the tree’s natural defense system to discourage pests and decay.
    When is tree removal the best option?
    Some trees require trimming more often than others do to maintain a safe distance from overhead power lines. To help ensure reliable electric service now and in the future, FPL will only remove select trees, palms and other fast-growing vegetation that cannot be managed effectively by pruning or trimming.
    Does FPL remove the trimmings/debris from the tree?
    When pruning is performed as part of our scheduled line clearing program, all resulting tree debris will be removed.
    Following named weather events, our crews must cut away trees and other vegetation that have fallen into power lines, or that are in the way, to find and fix damage safely and as quickly as possible. As our crews move along to restore power, they will leave debris where the tree fell. FPL will clear only the debris that directly affects electrical equipment and power lines or access to FPL equipment. It is the responsibility of the property owner or the local government to remove cuttings and tree debris. Please contact your local government’s waste management office or refuse service provider for information on refuse collection.
    How will I know when line-clearing crews will be in my neighborhood?
    FPL will send you a letter approximately two weeks before the line clearing begins. If access to your property is required, someone will contact you personally or leave a note with contact information at your door in advance of any work. You may see an increase of trucks and contractor activity as a result of these efforts. However, areas serviced by underground lines may not have visible activity within their vicinity. In these cases, the work takes place outside of neighborhoods where the initial electric service is provided by overhead lines.
    Why should I let line-clearing professionals on my property?
    Line clearing is not only important, it’s necessary. Scheduled line clearing near power lines and equipment helps ensure safety around electric facilities and minimizes the disruption of service to customers. Your cooperation is valuable in helping prevent outages to you and your neighbors.
    Will FPL shape my tree or prune other trees while they are here?
    FPL’s line-clearing professionals will only trim or prune trees around FPL electrical lines and equipment only. Trees that do not pose concerns to electrical lines and equipment will not be trimmed or pruned. To achieve any additional aesthetic goals, please hire a private contractor after our line-clearing professionals have completed the work.
    Can I prune or trim my trees myself, and does this mean FPL will no longer perform the trimming?
    FPL encourages customers to maintain their trees before they get too close to electric lines and equipment. You should never attempt to trim any vegetation growing near overhead power lines or on poles. Only specially trained line-clearing professionals should work around power lines. Check your local listings to locate a contractor qualified to trim vegetation around power lines. Before work begins, be sure to verify that the contractor is licensed and insured and complies with all applicable laws, codes, ordinances and/or permits.
    What kind of trees can I plant near power lines?
    First, visit the Right Tree, Right Place section of our Web site to find a list of recommended trees for the space you have available for planting. Next, consider where the tree will be located in relation to the overhead and underground power lines. Then, call 811 or visit www.call811.com at least two days before you dig. This free service will identify if there are any buried wires in the area where you would plant your tree.
    A tree is touching the power lines and sparking. What should I do?
    If you see a tree touching power lines and sparking or causing another hazardous tree condition, contact FPL immediately at 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243) to report the condition. Please do not attempt to trim any trees or vegetation growing on or near power lines. Safety is a core value at FPL, which is why we hire specially trained line-clearing professionals to perform this work.

  title: Underground Conversions Frequently Asked Questions
  link: https://www.fpl.com/reliability/underground-conversions.html
  body: >
    Underground power lines are more reliable than overhead lines – particularly during hurricanes and severe weather, when trees and vegetation and wind-blown debris can cause outages to overhead lines.
    In recent years, there has been growing interest by individual customers and communities in having their overhead lines replaced with underground lines to improve reliability or for aesthetic reasons.
    FPL has been installing underground service for decades and is committed to increasing our underground facilities. About 45% of our distribution system is already underground, compared to about 30% for other utilities nationwide. About 90% of the new distribution lines we install are underground.

  title: Ensuring Reliable Service Underground Power Line Conversions
  link: https://www.fpl.com/reliability/underground-conversions/faq.html
  body: >
    Home conversion
    Why do I need to hire an electrician?
    A certified electrician is needed in order to reconfigure the meter enclosure to receive the power from a pipe entering it from the underground and eliminate the overhead pipe.
    Why is there a charge for this service?
    FPL collects a payment for all underground material provided to you and for the labor associated with removing the overhead cable, supplying the new underground cable, pulling the underground cable through the new conduit, and building the casing on the pole that will house the new cable.
    What is the cost to convert my service from overhead to underground?
    Costs vary for an overhead to underground service conversion. If the request is for a standard residential service and the pole is located on your property, costs are based on tariff rates approved by the Florida Public Service Commission. To see rates, click here and go to Section 10.4. You will also incur expenses associated with the work performed by the electrician, an electrical permit and the burying of the FPL-issued conduit. (Note: Since this work may trigger building codes that require older home wiring to be brought up to today’s standards, it’s important to check with the proper authorities before getting started.) Once you’re ready to request a conversion, you can apply at fpl.com/construction.
    How do I know if my electrical service qualifies as a standard residential service?
    A standard residential service ranges between 100 amps and 320 amps. Additionally, the future underground service would not exceed one bend in the ground. If you are not sure of the size of your service, check by looking at your FPL meter. If you see AC, ACD, ACP, ACR, 5C, 5CJ or 7C written on the meter, then your service qualifies.
    Do I need to hire someone to install the FPL-issued underground conduit?
    No. The conduit can be installed by anyone, even you, as long as proper FPL specifications are adhered to during the installation.
    Should I contact FPL before covering the trench for the underground conduit?
    Yes. FPL needs to inspect the depth of the trench and pipe in order to assure that it meets National Electrical Code standards.
    If I elect to install the conduit myself, what do I have to do?
    Make sure that the trench route meets FPL specifications. Once this is done, call toll-free "Sunshine State One Call of Florida" at 1-800-432-4770 two full business days in advance to arrange to have the location of any buried lines marked. By law, anyone excavating must follow this procedure to ensure the safety of people and property.
    Does FPL deliver the conduit to my property?
    No. Once payment has been received by FPL, it is your responsibility to coordinate with the local FPL service center to pick up the material. (Note: Make appropriate transportation arrangements since PVC sections come in 20-foot lengths.)
    Once I have the conduit installed, how long will it take FPL to convert the service?
    Appointments typically take two to three weeks to schedule the work. Once the material has been purchased, installed and inspected by an FPL representative and the governing authority, you can request an appointment. Generally, your electrician will be present; FPL will disconnect the existing overhead service upon our arrival and the electrician will make the necessary changes on your equipment. In the meantime, FPL will remove the overhead service cable, build the housing for the cable on the pole, and pull the cable in the conduit. Once the electrician has completed the work, FPL will reconnect the service that same day.
    How can I tell if there is an existing underground electrical riser on the pole?
    When you look at the pole with your existing overhead service, look at the height of the current pole attachment and see if there are any cables originating from that height descending the pole in either a galvanized pipe or a U-shaped PVC guard. If this condition exists, you will need to count how many of these underground risers exist on the pole, and reflect it on the Overhead to Underground Conversion Sketch Form. If there is more than one pipe on the pole, you will need to contact your FPL representative. See examples below:
    Why does FPL need to know if there are existing underground risers on the pole?
    FPL will not install more than two underground risers on a pole because of potential safety issues with our employees. If there are more than two risers, employees are unable to climb the pole. When this condition exists, FPL will issue, at no additional cost to you, an underground box that needs to be installed at the base of the pole adjacent to the existing riser. FPL will then upgrade the cable in the existing riser to serve two properties instead of one. (Note: When installing the underground box or handhole, as FPL refers to it, you will need to enter the 90-degree bend from the pole into the box, leaving a break in the conduit, and extending the remaining conduit from this point on toward the location of the meter.)
    Is it possible to bury my cable TV and telephone cables in the same trench?
    Yes, you can bury all other utilities in the same trench; however, you will need to contact both your cable and telephone providers independently. FPL is not responsible for their facilities.
    What is an inaccessible location?
    If you are unable to drive up to the pole with your car, then that would constitute an inaccessible location. FPL requires this information so that we can bring the right equipment to perform the work.
    Do mobile homes qualify for a conversion of the service cable from overhead to underground?
    No. Electrical codes do not allow meter cans on mobile homes. For more information, contact your FPL representative.
    I am thinking of building a pool in the future. How does that affect my request for underground service?
    If your proposed underground service route is in the back of your property and it interferes with future plans of adding a pool, then your best bet will be to install the pipe around the proposed pool area and as close to the property lines as possible, being diligent in maintaining appropriate safety clearances from power lines to pools. You will need to discuss these clearances with your FPL representative. Also keep in mind that this might affect the cost of the work.
    Community conversion
    What is FPL’s standard service?
    FPL and other utilities use the overhead standard established by the Florida Public Service Commission as the most cost-effective type of construction. However, we are open to putting lines underground provided the additional cost is covered by or for the customer.
    Why is there a differential cost for new underground service?
    It is the PSC’s and FPL’s position that it would be unfair to charge all customers a higher price to cover the cost of new underground service, since not everyone would get the benefit or necessarily be willing or able to pay the higher cost.
    Why must the customer or requesting party pay for the conversion from overhead to underground?
    Similar to new service requests for underground service, conversions take into account the requirement that FPL provide electric service to all its customers in the most cost-effective manner available and this is typically an overhead system.
    But I live in a community with underground service and I didn’t pay anything extra – why is that?
    You may not realize it, but you did. For aesthetic reasons, many developers work with FPL and other utility companies to bury their lines when they are first planning out the construction of a new neighborhood. The added cost for underground service and other community amenities is typically included in the price you pay for a new home.
    What does underground service cost in a new subdivision vs. new overhead service?
    Usually, the basic costs are about a third more, but may be more if additional work needs to be done on supporting electrical facilities such as putting a section of an adjacent main line underground. The builder/homeowner is responsible for paying the cost difference between new overhead and new underground facilities prior to construction. The detailed cost components are provided in an FPL tariff that is available from your local FPL Project Representative. [See FPL Electric Tariff sheets 6.090-6.100.]
    What are my options if I live in an established neighborhood served by overhead electrical service and I want to convert my service to underground?
    You can personally arrange to have your individual service drop converted from overhead to underground or seek conversion of all the neighborhood electrical facilities through your city or homeowners association. Converting an older community’s power lines from overhead to underground, however, can be very expensive and disruptive, especially in highly urbanized areas. In conversion, the applicant pays the total cost of the conversion, since service already exists that must be dismantled in addition to installing a whole new system.
    What’s involved in converting my service drop?
    Customers who wish to have the line to their home buried will also need to convert the meter can and downpipe to accept underground service. This requires a licensed electrician and in most cases an electrical permit. Since this work may trigger building codes that require older home wiring to be brought up to today’s standards, it’s important to check with the proper authorities before getting started. Homeowners also need to arrange for a trench to be dug from the pole to the meter location to hold FPL-provided PVC for the underground cable.
    Can you be more specific about some of the costs I may be facing if I pursue converting my individual overhead service to underground?
    To convert your service, there is a flat fee of $651.49 that would be due to FPL along with possible additional costs that depend on a number of variables such as:
    Whether your local government’s electrical authority requires electrical installation or wiring to be upgraded as part of your conversion
    Whether an electrician (or another tradesperson) will do the work to dig and backfill the trench needed to bring the underground facilities from the easement to the building
    The length of trench that’s needed to accommodate the conversion
    Whether the existing overhead “weatherhead” extends through the roof of the building, in which case you may need to incur the cost of roof repair as well as paint and aesthetics. These costs and arrangements are separate from the work FPL would handle and are the responsibility of the customer, just as they would be in seeking to convert from a septic tank to a sewer system or other similar efforts.
    Who can request that all overhead facilities in a community be converted to underground?
    Existing neighborhood overhead lines can be converted if a community so desires. Anyone willing and able to pay the cost for the conversion and secure the necessary easements to place the facilities on private property may submit a written request. This includes local governments, large or small communities, builders and developers in a contained specific area such as a subdivision.
    Does conversion from overhead to underground require a unanimous agreement from all property owners within the conversion area before FPL will convert its facilities to underground?
    Generally, yes, due to the following conditions for such conversion. Easements: All the easements (property use agreements from owners) must be acquired before an underground electrical distribution system can be installed. If FPL can design around an occasional customer who refuses to provide an easement – without jeopardizing the integrity of its electrical system – FPL will attempt to do so. In the case of converting to underground, this also means deciding whose property will accept the new padmounted transformer(s) and fairly large switch cabinet(s) that sit above ground as part of the underground grid. Cost: It’s also necessary for all the requesting parties to determine and agree in advance and on the allocation of the conversion costs among those benefiting from the project before FPL can begin construction. Otherwise, subsequent disagreements can bog down the conversion effort and drive up costs. Since FPL’s tariff requires full payment of the calculated customer contribution amount prior to beginning construction, customers may want to consider other options to offset some of the project costs. These options could include taking responsibility for doing some of the boring and/or trenching and installing the conduit. Regardless of who does the work, the installation must meet FPL standards for safety and reliability and local electrical and building-code requirements.
    Can the requester have a contractor perform the conversion work?
    Yes, that’s an option. The tariff requires only that the work be performed to FPL standards and the facilities be maintained and operated by FPL. We are currently working on drafting the appropriate agreements to be able to allow our customers this option. We should have more information in the next several months.
    What might it cost to convert from overhead to underground service?
    The two key drivers contributing to the cost calculations are labor and materials. Depending on these factors, underground facilities can cost anywhere from $500,000 per mile to more than $4 million per mile. While these figures have a considerable amount of variability, there is a process in place where we generate a “ballpark” estimate to assist in determining the magnitude of the cost a community may be considering.
    How does the new FPL undergrounding tariff work?
    In 2003, FPL set up a PSC-approved rule and process (tariff) for cities who wanted to have the option of converting to underground in designated areas and who needed a mechanism to recover their costs. Under this new tariff, a city could pay to make the conversion and then recover its costs over a designated timeframe by having FPL add an underground fee on the bills of those customers in their jurisdiction who would be benefiting from the conversion. (Fees may not exceed [1] 15 percent of a customer’s bill or [2] $30 for residential and $50 for every 5,000 kilowatt-hour commercial.) No such arrangements have as yet been established in our service territory under this new tariff.
    Are there different ways the conversion of a full neighborhood or city might be financed?
    Yes. For cities, FPL recently established, with PSC approval, a mechanism to recover the costs associated with converting from overhead to underground by adding a fee to customer bills. Additionally, Chapters 197 and 170 of the Florida Statutes allow municipalities to fund underground conversion costs by levying special assessments imposed on tax bills. Landowners benefiting from the conversion must be identified and the special assessment may be collected directly from the local government imposing the assessment or through annual property tax bills. Another Florida Statute – 125.01(q) – lets counties establish municipal service benefit units and municipal service taxing units in certain areas. These governmental units may levy service charges, special assessments or taxes within these units to fund underground conversion costs.
    Why must some of the equipment in an underground system remain above ground?
    While conduit and cable can be placed underground, which eliminates poles and wire, transformers and switch cabinets need to be accessible to FPL crews at ground level for timely maintenance, outage repairs, rerouting power and other functions.
    In the case of conversions, what is FPL’s preferred method of burrowing underground to lay cable and conduit and why?
    Directional boring is generally preferred in conversions to minimize impact on other utilities, which are generally buried higher in the ground than electrical conduit and cable. Directional boring, while it may save on site restoration costs, is substantially more expensive work to perform. Open trenching is usually preferable for the paying party because it is the least expensive method available. In addition, an advantage of trenching is that other underground utilities may use the same trench, reducing the collective cost of burying all different facilities. This, however, requires significant coordination. A disadvantage of open trenching is the amount of surface restoration required – such as landscaping and sidewalks. Given that the locations of other utilities are not always known, especially in older communities, there is still a risk associated with both trenching and boring that may impact other subsurface utilities, such as water and sewer lines, gas lines or drainage lines.
    Does FPL do overhead-to-underground conversions in rear easements?
    Front easements are required for new construction, and are also typically required for conversions from overhead to underground as they allow for quicker access to the facilities. Should a power outage occur, facilities in the rear of a property may be inaccessible due to locked gates or dogs on the property. The inability to get to transformers and other equipment could delay the restoration of an entire neighborhood. FPL would consider locating easements in the rear of the property if an access road or alley existed that would allow for quick access to the facilities. The 10-feet easement requirement would still apply.
    Why must the easements associated with underground facilities be at least 10-feet wide?
    Ten feet is our standard easement requirement for “front” distribution neighborhoods in order to provide: (a) adequate space for the necessary pad-mounted transformer and underground cables (b) sufficient area for FPL crews to safely work away from roadways and (c) enough room for other utilities that might occupy the same easement to install future cable and conduit without interfering with the electric transformers located in the same vicinity. Each pad-mounted switch cabinet requires a 20-foot by 20-foot easement for installation and operation.
    If easements are difficult to obtain, why not place underground facilities in the public right-of-way instead of on private property?
    Typically, the only facilities FPL places in the public right-of-way are those necessary to cross under streets, like cable and conduit. The reason is that otherwise every road widening or improvement project could potentially compromise the company’s ability to deliver safe, reliable, uninterrupted power. On the other hand, if a local government was to offer FPL an easement or equivalent (a signed legal agreement) located in the public right-of-way, we would consider this alternative only if we cannot physically install the cable in private property. Only cable and conduit are allowed in the public rights-of-way in these rare cases. These public right-of-way easements would also need to be legally conveyed and expressly reserved on FPL record drawings. However, it’s been our experience that local governments are reluctant to grant such right-of-way easements or easement equivalents. As for other facilities and equipment needed for underground, such as primary splice boxes, transformers and switch cabinets, these components of the underground system would still need private property easements for us to be able to routinely access and maintain the equipment and ensure reliable service.
    Can I have just the lines in front of my house buried if no one else in my neighborhood wants to participate?
    For system reliability reasons, FPL will only convert the system to underground if one full block or more is converted at the same time. FPL's typical underground system is a "looped" system, which means power can be supplied to the same transformer from two different directions. Depending on the location, more than one block may need to be converted in order to complete this "loop."
    What makes it so much more expensive to do conversions vs. new construction, especially considering that the customer pays for most of the peripheral work?
    In conversions, FPL’s costs are significant. The work includes building a whole new system, while operating the existing service and then dismantling the existing service once the new one is up and running. The higher costs also reflect the fact that conversions in older neighborhoods – regardless of the type of excavation we use (boring or trenching) – have a lot of issues associated with working in-and-around and avoiding impact to other utilities such as phone, cable, sewer, gas lines, water lines, etc. Finally, all new underground components must be acquired and installed, including conduit, cable (wire), pad-mounted transformers and switch cabinets. Additionally, shared main line work is usually required, which is even more costly than converting individual service and neighborhood lines. Typically, dismantling represents about 15 percent of the cost, installing underground components about 65 percent, and actual excavation about 20 percent.
    What are some of the impacts associated with converting an older overhead system to new underground?
    Converting from an overhead to an underground system means basically abandoning an existing working grid system. The logistics of converting an existing grid system in an established neighborhood can be considerably more expensive and disruptive to personal property and surroundings than, for example, building new. For example, utilities often share poles above ground, so that if the objective is to move utilities underground – it’s not just electrical service that needs to be considered, but also phone, cable television and Internet service. This then presents additional considerations, such as different spacing requirements, boring and/or trenching needs and ground-level switching boxes involved in providing each type of service. Driveways, sidewalks, fences, landscaping, sprinkler systems and yards may need to be torn up or may be inadvertently damaged if not clearly delineated. Entry and exit ways to homes and business could be impacted for extensive periods of time. Because permits are needed to change meter-related equipment, conversions in older homes and neighborhoods may end up triggering city or county requirements that homeowners/businesses bring interior wiring up to current code. This could require the expense of a licensed electrician and potentially extensive interior rewiring and remodeling. Finally, legal easements are needed from all conversion participants that allow FPL access to its underground equipment, including the above-ground components – and a number of people must agree to have the large green transformer box and pad or other switching boxes in their yards.
    How long does it take to get a “ballpark” estimate?
    Typically, it may take from two to three weeks. This time period may vary depending on several factors such as:
    The complexity of the job
    Geographic size of the area to be converted
    Facilities involved and type of equipment needed
    The electrical load being served, including the population density and number of switch cabinets required
    The current workload of FPL Project Representatives.
    What will it cost to bury the other utilities such as telephone and cable television?
    This question will need to be addressed by the other utilities.
    What are some examples of instances where proposed overhead-to-underground conversions would not be feasible?
    Examples include instances in which private property owners aren’t willing to provide the easements that are necessary for FPL to design and engineer the conversion; locations where necessary safety standards and operational clearances cannot be met, for example extremely congested areas where switch cabinets cannot be installed with sufficient operating clearances; and areas prone to flooding. (Excessive flooding can short out transformers, which then cannot be safely restored until flood waters recede.)
    What experience does FPL have assisting any groups with evaluating or actually accomplishing a conversion?
    Actually, our experience is limited, as many government entities or neighborhoods have abandoned the idea after fully investigating the impacts. In other cases, voters have determined the disadvantages of conversion outweighed the advantages and have failed to authorize funding. Some exceptions have involved city-initiated, limited-scope conversions involving primarily a few downtown streets, such as in beach towns in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Sarasota counties.
    How does FPL ensure the “ballpark" estimates are consistent throughout the territory?
    FPL is working on establishing a comprehensive, standard plan and process that takes into account the many variations in types of facilities and different population densities across the system. The “ballpark" estimate is simply an order of magnitude (for example – $5,000 vs. $500,000) to assist the requestor in determining if they want to move forward with a conversion project and seek a binding estimate. Unfortunately, due to innumerable variables, there is no single blanket cost.
    Can FPL provide a simple cost or range of cost for conversion from overhead to underground based on dollars per linear foot?
    No. There are just too many factors and variables that are unique and distinct to each conversion request.
    How long does it take to get a detailed, binding estimate?
    Typically it takes approximately 10 to 15 weeks (pending agreement on easement locations) to obtain a binding estimate. However, this timeframe may vary due to the size and complexity of the job, the facilities involved and other factors.
    How does FPL ensure the binding estimates are consistent throughout the territory?
    All estimates are actual “for-construction” estimates good for a period of 180 days where all material and labor are inventoried in our computer-based estimating system. This is the same system used for construction estimates for all FPL work system-wide. In addition, the PSC rule governing overhead to underground conversions specifies exactly how the charges are to be calculated. [See Florida Administrative Code 25-6.115, and FPL’s Electric Tariff sheets 6.300 – 6.330, specifically.]
    Are any credits available for existing facilities that can be salvaged, and will they be factored into my estimate?
    Some salvage credits may be available. Salvage value is only given for equipment that can be removed from the field and then re-issued for use with no testing or refurbishing required before re-use such as concrete poles. Typically these credits are not significant. [See FPL Electric Tariff sheet 6.300].
    Just for comparison, and using a sample subdivision, can you give me a rough idea of the difference in cost to install standard overhead service vs. underground service in new construction?
    Depending on the density of a new development and exclusive of other facility needs, it costs FPL between $1,344 and $2,272 per lot to install our standard overhead service. Underground, on the other hand, costs between $1,052 and $2,414 per lot. The builder/homeowner selecting to have underground service pays up to $266 in differential cost. In addition, if main feeder lines are required to serve the subdivision, and the developer requests those be placed underground also, there is an additional differential charge of $9.02 per foot of main line and $27,200 per pad-mounted switch cabinet installed. In a typical 100-lot subdivision needing main feeder work and about two switch cabinets and related equipment, this could add an additional $60,000 to the project, doubling or tripling the per-lot differential cost.
    How many miles of community distribution power lines does FPL have in its system?
    FPL has approximately 67,000 miles of distribution lines serving its 4.7 million customers in all or parts of 35 counties in Florida. In addition, we also have about 6,500 miles of transmission lines. More than one-third of FPL’s system – or in excess of 24,000 miles – is underground. Often it’s as a result of municipalities having set underground requirements, the costs of which are borne by builders and developers and ultimately by customers in the price they pay for real estate. However, it’s important to remember that lines eventually come above ground, so no system is totally underground.
    Why don’t you put transmission lines underground?
    FPL transmission lines – that is, those large power lines that move power over long distances like an interstate highway from power plants to our neighborhoods – are rarely ever placed underground due to their complexity and considerably higher costs, as well as security and reliability considerations. The cost of placing these lines underground can be five to 15 times more costly than an overhead transmission line.
