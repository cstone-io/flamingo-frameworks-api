    1. Let's look at one example using the illustration below. One of the most common causes of power flickers is when a tree branch or palm frond is blown into overhead power lines. When the branch makes contact with our lines (A), the system detects the interference and shuts off electricity to that section of the line for a brief period – usually a few seconds (B). The tree branch or palm frond typically falls to the ground, allowing service to be restored quickly.
    2. This process allows the system to determine if there is a break in the line or other electrical difficulty. Briefly shutting off power and isolating the problem area helps prevent damage to the electric system, which could result in a longer outage and affect many more customers.
    3. For example, a flicker on your local power line could affect electric service for you and 200 of your neighbors. Without this brief interruption, the outage could last several hours, spread to other power lines, and affect service for thousands of customers.

    3. Power flickers can even affect your service if you receive electricity from an underground power line. Underground wires ultimately connect with overhead lines and equipment located elsewhere on the power grid, away from your immediate area. Animals and reptiles also sometimes interfere with underground power cables.

    1. What causes power flickers?
      - "There are several factors that can trigger power flickers: lightning, damaged electrical equipment, and objects making contact with power lines, including tree branches, palm fronds, and vegetation – even animals
    2. Why do they occur in good weather – even on a sunny day?
      - "While power flickers are more common during stormy or windy conditions, they can occur at any time and in any weather. The causes of flickers – animals and vegetation making contact with power lines, lightning, and other factors – never take a rest."
    3. Why are homes and businesses served by an underground power line affected by flickers?
      - "Even if you receive electric service from underground power lines, you may be affected by brief outages because the underground wires ultimately connect with overhead lines and equipment – including power substations – that may be located away from your neighborhood. In addition, animals and reptiles sometimes interfere with our underground power cables, causing flickers or longer outages."

    Those Annoying Electric Disturbances
    Electric disturbances can appear in different forms. Some aren’t even noticeable but may leave signs such as a shrunken picture on your TV or computer screen. Brief Power Interruptions (Flickers)
    When your digital clock or DVD player blinks or your lights go off for a few seconds, you’ve experienced the most common power disturbance problem, a flicker. Flickers can be caused by: » Lightning strikes » Tree branches making contact with power lines » Vehicle accidents involving electrical equipment » Construction accidents involving power lines » Salt spray affecting FPL equipment » Damage to underground equipment Flickers are usually harmless and resolve themselves quickly. Here’s an example of how a flicker occurs: A palm tree frond comes into contact with a power line. FPL’s system automatically switches off electricity to give the frond time to clear the line. Once the frond is clear of power lines, FPL’s system resets itself. By switching off electricity for a few seconds, FPL prevents a full power outage. Surges and Spikes
    Unexpected burdens on the electric system, often from lightning, can cause a brief but intense increase in the amount of electricity in your home. Though they usually last less than a second, these surges and spikes can affect sensitive electronic equipment. Find out how to best protect your electronic devices on the "Protect Your Home or Business Against Power Disturbances" page.

  body: >
    If you are experiencing power issues, there are a few simple checks you can perform before calling FPL or your electrician. Sometimes solving the problem is simply a matter of keeping track of when problems occur and which equipment is affected. Are your neighbors affected?
    If not, check your circuit breaker, fuse box or main breaker before calling an electrician or FPL. Reset a breaker or replace a fuse. If you live in an apartment building and only your power is out, call your building's maintenance person for assistance. If your entire apartment complex's lights are flickering or out:
    Call FPL at 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243)
    Report the outage online Does the problem come and go?
    Look for patterns. More than likely something might have interfered to cause a quick on and off of electricity. Things that you may want to consider when looking for patterns:
    Does the problem happen at the same time of day?
    Is construction work going on in your neighborhood?
    How was the weather?
    Was there a loud noise outside the home?
    Have you added any new appliances to your household? Being aware of patterns can be a valuable tool for you, an electrician or FPL in finding the cause and solution to your power disturbances. Is other household equipment running at the same time?
    Find out if sensitive equipment is sharing the same electrical circuit as large appliances or motors, or if too much equipment is on one circuit. If so, relocate the sensitive equipment to a different outlet or circuit. Has recent work been performed on your home's electrical system? Have you recently added new appliances or equipment to your home?
    Check your installation manual, troubleshooting guide, or call the electrician who did the work to find out if incorrect installation, grounding or wiring is causing problems with other equipment in your home. Is the problem happening with only one specific appliance or electronic device?
    If so, review the instruction manual provided with the item to see if it provides troubleshooting tips or contact the manufacturer for assistance and advice with identifying the cause of the problem. Also, you may want to check to see if the equipment is plugged into a ground fault interrupt (GFI) outlet. Troubleshoot a GFI outlet. Are lights in your home going dim or bright and staying dim for an extended period of time?
    When lights in your home stay dim for an extended period, turn off major appliances and call FPL. Is there static on your cordless telephone, radio or television when another appliance is running?
    The problem may be electrical interference. Troubleshoot electrical interference. When simple solutions don't work
    Power outages and electrical disturbances can be caused by problems within your home, such as:
    Circuit overloads
    Electrical short circuits
    Home wiring damage If the solutions here don't work, or you suspect you have electrical problems at your home, contact a qualified electrical contractor or electrician. Friends and relatives are your best source for references.

    Resetting your breakers can sometimes restore power to your home. If your power goes out, check to see if your neighbors' lights are still on. If they are, you can try to resolve your issue by resetting your breakers. This may get your power back on right away
    Here's an easy, three-step guide to resetting your breakers:
    Find the breaker panel in your home - it may be in your garage - and turn off every breaker, one by one.
    Next, reset your main breaker. If your main breaker is not in your breaker panel, it will be outside near your electric meter. Do not touch the meter. Open the panel beside the meter. Reset the main breaker by turning the switch off and on two times. Leave the switch in the on position.
    Return to the breaker panel inside your home and turn each breaker back to the on position, one by one. In many cases, power is now restored.
    Keep these safety tips in mind when resetting your breakers:
    Don't use any tools. Your breakers are easily accessible by hand.
    Don't touch the electric meter.
    Don't stand in water when turning breakers on or off.
    If your power still does not come on after completing this process, please call us at 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243).

    Ground Fault Interrupt (GFI) circuits most often provide power to outlets located wherever water can be a threat. For example, they are often found near sinks, tubs, in garages and on the exterior of your home.
    A special GFI outlet is designed to shut off electricity to the entire circuit in order to prevent electrical shock. To restore electricity to the circuit, the GFI outlet must be reset. Follow these steps to reset your GFI outlet:
    Unplug cord-connected equipment from the outlets served by the GFI circuit.
    Locate the specific outlet that includes the GFI reset switch.
    Reset the switch (make sure you are pressing the "reset" button, not the "test" button).
    If the switch does not reset, contact your electrician for assistance.

  title: Troubleshooting Electrical Interference
  link: https://www.fpl.com/reliability/power-disturbances/electrical-interference.html
  body: >
    High frequency electromagnetic signals can create electrical interference in:
    Televisions
    Radios
    Computers
    Cordless phones
    If there is static on your cordless telephone, radio or television when another appliance is running, your problem may be electrical interference. Sometimes it takes just a few minutes to find out what is causing electrical interference and to eliminate the source.
    Finding the source of electrical interference
    The best solution to electrical interference is eliminating the source. Follow the steps below to discover the source of electrical interference in your home:
    Turn on the appliance that is experiencing the interference - for example, the phone or radio that has static.
    Go the breaker box and flip each circuit breaker in your home off and then on again while someone stays with the affected appliance.
    The interference will disappear when the breaker causing it is flipped off.
    Turn the offending breaker back on to confirm it is the source.
    Identify the electrical devices in your home connected to the breaker and turn them on.
    Turn the electrical devices off, one by one, until the interference disappears.
    Once you find the device that is causing the interference, repair or replace it.
    If you cannot locate the equipment that is causing the interference, report it:
    a.  Report trouble online
    b.  Call 1-800-4OUTAGE (1-800-468-8243)
    Interference problems due to loose connections
    Electrical interference can be caused by loose connections or bad wiring behind a wall, panel or outlet. Have a qualified electrician conduct an inspection of your wiring system to identify and eliminate the interference conditions.
    Interference problems originating outside
    If none of the above measures are successful, the chances are that the interference is coming from outside. You can also request an electric interference investigation. Note: If you have not registered, you will be asked to complete a one-time registration. You will need your FPL account number and the last four digits of the Social Security or Tax ID number that is associated with your account.

    Once a line is selected for maintenance as part of the scheduled program:
    - The entire length of the power line is checked for vegetation issues.
    - Trees and any other vegetation that are in the direct path of the power line are identified for maintenance.
    - FPL's qualified tree-trimming contractors perform the work using “directional pruning.”

    Trees that interfere with FPL facilities and cannot be pruned without dramatically affecting the shape or health of the tree are completely removed. Trees with high growth rates, exotic weed trees, and trees in poor health are prime targets for removal. The customer is notified in advance of the tree’s removal and, as a courtesy, consent is obtained before removing the tree. After a tree is trimmed or removed, the remaining debris is collected before the end of the next day except during any restoration efforts immediately following a storm.

  link: "https://www.fpl.com/reliability/trees/tree-location.html"
  body: >
    Here are five simple steps to smart landscaping:
    1. Find the Right Tree – Trees come in all shapes and sizes, and often change dramatically over their lifetimes. Some grow tall, some grow wide, and some have extensive root systems. Before selecting your tree, make sure you know how tall, wide, and deep it will be at maturity. For lists of recommended trees for your region of Florida, please visit the University of Florida’s “Trees and Power Lines” website.
    2. Choose the Right Spot – If you’re planting trees on your property, look up and note the location of power lines. Before you plant, keep in mind the setback dimensions in our diagram. Think about how your tree will impact existing utility lines as it grows taller, wider, and deeper. Keeping trees away from power lines means that, in the event they blow over or tree limbs become loose, they’re much less likely to hit a power line and knock out power. This also keeps debris farther away from the lines to speed power restoration efforts.

  title: "Why Does FPL Prune Trees?"
  link: "https://www.fpl.com/reliability/trees/faq.html"
  body: >
    To assure reliable service for our customers, FPL follows a preventive maintenance program to regularly clear tree branches and limbs from electrical equipment and lines to help prevent outages. FPL will only prune or trim branches and limbs that can potentially cause safety hazards and power outages by brushing against or falling upon power lines during windy weather.

document_25_2:
  title: "How Much Will Be Cut from My Trees?"
  link: "https://www.fpl.com/reliability/trees/faq.html"
  body: >
    FPL’s line-clearing program will only target trees and other vegetation that can interfere with or damage power lines and equipment. The amount of pruning varies by tree and location, and our specially trained line-clearing professionals will consider each tree’s species, growth rate, health, and the relative location to electrical lines and equipment before pruning. We all appreciate a lush, green community, and we can have it in such a way that minimizes the likelihood that tree branches and limbs will knock down power lines.

document_25_3:
  title: "Why Does My Tree Have a V-Shape Following Utility Pruning?"
  link: "https://www.fpl.com/reliability/trees/faq.html"
  body: >
    FPL uses a directional pruning method to direct future tree growth away from power lines and help make our electrical system more reliable in the future. This means that only the tree’s interior branches that are growing toward the electrical lines and equipment are removed. Since the roots act as an anchoring system, this will not affect the stability of the tree.

document_25_4:
  title: "Which Pruning Guidelines Does FPL Follow?"
  link: "https://www.fpl.com/reliability/trees/faq.html"
  body: >
    FPL and its contractors follow directional pruning guidelines set by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to protect the health of trees while helping them to grow away from power lines. ANSI A-300 is accepted as the industry standard for tree and plant pruning and is endorsed by the National Arbor Day Foundation and the International Society of Arboriculture.

  body: >
    Underground power lines are more reliable than overhead lines – particularly during hurricanes and severe weather, when trees and vegetation and wind-blown debris can cause outages to overhead lines.
    In recent years, there has been growing interest by individual customers and communities in having their overhead lines replaced with underground lines to improve reliability or for aesthetic reasons.
    FPL has been installing underground service for decades and is committed to increasing our underground facilities. About 45% of our distribution system is already underground, compared to about 30% for other utilities nationwide. About 90% of the new distribution lines we install are underground.
